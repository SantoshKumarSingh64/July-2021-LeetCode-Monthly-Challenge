<h1>Isomorphic Strings</h1>
<p><br>
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.<br>
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.<br>
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.<br>
<br> 
Example 1:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: s = "egg", t = "add"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: true<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: false<br>
<br>
Example 3:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: s = "paper", t = "title"<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: true<br>
<br> <br>
Constraints:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;•	1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4<br>
&emsp;&emsp;•	t.length == s.length<br>
&emsp;&emsp;•	s and t consist of any valid ascii character.<br>
