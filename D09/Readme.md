<h1>Longest Increasing Subsequence</h1>
<p><br>
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.<br>
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].<br>
<br> 
Example 1:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: 4<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.<br>
<br>
Example 2:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: 4<br>
<br>
Example 3:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: 1<br>
<br><br> 
Constraints:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;•	1 <= nums.length <= 2500<br>
&emsp;&emsp;•	-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4<br>
